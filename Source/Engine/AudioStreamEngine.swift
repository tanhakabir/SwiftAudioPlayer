/**
 Start of the streaming chain. Get PCM buffer from lower chain and feed it to
 engine
 
 Main responsibilities:
 POLL FOR BUFFER. When we start a stream it takes time for the lower chain to
 receive audio format. We don't know how long this would take. Therefore we poll
 continually. We also poll continually when user seeks because they could have
 seeked beyond pcm buffer, and down-chain buffer. We keep polling until we fill
 N buffers. If we stick to one buffer the audio sounds choppy because sometimes
 the parser takes longer than usual to parse a buffer
 
 RECURSE FOR BUFFER. When we receive N buffers we switch to recursive mode. This
 means we only ask for the next buffer when one of the loaded buffers are
 used up. This is to prevent high CPU usage (100%) because otherwise we keep
 polling and parser keeps parsing even though the user is nowhere near that
 part of audio
 
 UPDATES FOR UI. Duration, needle ticking, playing status, etc.
 
 HANDLE PLAYING. Ensure the engine is in the correct state when playing,
 pausing, or seeking
